    "To solve this system of functions, use the generalized Newton's Method as discussed in class.  Use the Jacobian Matrix, and construct it by analytically/symbollically calculating the partial derivatives for its elements.  Iterate the solutions of the matrix equations by adding the evaluated steps back into the previous guess values for $x$, $y$, and $z$.  For this question, you may fulfill the iteration sensitivity when either the total of the step components or the total of the residual function values acheives an error less than 0.00001.\n",

To do this, from your Lab 4 Jupyter notebook, select \"File-->Download as-->Python (.py)\".  Save this file as \"Lab4.py\" in the directory of this notebook.  Then below, add the line \"from Lab4 import BackSub\".  It may load and perform all computations, but you will not have access to your previous functions in this notebook.  If you click on the margin beside this cell, it will reduce in size.  If you double click, it should completely collapse."
